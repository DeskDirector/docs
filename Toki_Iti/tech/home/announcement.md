### PRODUCT UPDATE

The feature release list has been an excellent way to share product updates, but it has gradually taken over the entire page and still lacks detailed context. As a result, we have moved them to a [separate page](/configs/release-notes/feature-releases) and are only highlighting three of the most recent features here. 

* Global API Key (Admin [2.10](/configs/release-notes/admin/v2.10))
* Personal API Key (Admin [2.10](/configs/release-notes/admin/v2.10))

More information can be found on [the feature releases page](/configs/release-notes/feature-releases).
