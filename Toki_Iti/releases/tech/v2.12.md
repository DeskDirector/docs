## Highlights

### Copilot

The Copilot assistance feature is now available to help agents respond to service tickets more efficiently. It allows agents to easily rephrase their writingâ€”whether to improve clarity or make the text more formal. Additionally, agents can engage in a conversation with Copilot for a more tailored experience. Whether summarizing the current service ticket, answering technical questions, or drafting a task list, Copilot simplifies ticket resolution and enhances productivity.
