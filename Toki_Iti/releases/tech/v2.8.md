## Highlight

#### Revamped Contact Creation Page in TECH Portal

We're thrilled to introduce a significant update to the TECH portal's interface, marking a departure from its unchanged appearance over the past 4 to 5 years. In this latest release, we've devoted considerable time to completely overhaul the contact creation page, enhancing both its functionality and user experience.

###### Cultural Adaptation and Compliance with W3C Standards

In a bid to better accommodate diverse cultural backgrounds and adhere to W3C's specifications, we've made significant adjustments. Notably, the terminology for personal names has been refined: "first name" and "last name" have been replaced with "given name" and "surname," respectively. This alteration not only reflects a more inclusive approach but also ensures compatibility with a wide array of cultural naming conventions.

###### Enhanced Flexibility with Full Name Field

We recognize that names vary in complexity across different cultures, and to streamline this process, we've introduced the "full name" field. Gone are the restrictions of specifying only a "first name"; now, users can input names in any order â€“ be it family name first, given name first, or incorporating multiple middle names. This flexibility empowers users to accurately represent their names according to their preferences and cultural norms.

###### Personalized Communication with Mail Nickname

Moreover, we're introducing the option to specify a "mail nickname." This feature allows users to personalize communication within the system. Whether it's "Sir John" or "Lady Elizabeth," individuals can designate the name by which they prefer to be addressed in email correspondence, adding a touch of customization to their interactions.

We believe these updates not only modernize the TECH portal but also foster a more inclusive and user-centric platform, ensuring a seamless experience for all users, regardless of cultural background or naming convention.
