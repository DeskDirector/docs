### Supplementary forms
Introducing the new Supplementary Form feature! Say goodbye to the limitations of the old inline form system. With Supplementary Form, agents can attach customized forms to tickets, providing invaluable context and clarity. But that's not all â€“ agents can also pre-populate these forms, streamlining the process and saving time for both themselves and ticket owners. Plus, with the ability to fill the form progressively and remember any modifications, collaboration between agents and ticket owners has never been smoother. Say hello to a more efficient and seamless ticketing experience with Supplementary Form.
