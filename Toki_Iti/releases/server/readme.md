### 24th of Feb 2025 (v21.19.1)
{.release-note-list}
- **IMPROVED** Reduced server cold start time by enabling .NET's ReadyToRun (R2R) compilation.  
- **FIXED** The `Prefer` header is no longer allowed in the form and form result APIs to specify the description format for each question. This change aligns with the original feature design.  
- **IMPROVED** Enhanced security for the TECH portal API by introducing granular user security profiles. Users now have either read-only or read-and-write permissions for specific entities, replacing the previous broad access model. This allows for more precise permission control, particularly for service tickets.  
- **ADDED** Introduced a new access permission property in the ticket's `$info`, enabling the UI to recognize the current user's access level for a given ticket.  
- **ADDED** Introduced a new v4 ticket API to search for assignable agents for a given ticket.  
- **ADDED** Added two new v4 ticket APIs to retrieve form results linked to a ticket or ticket comment, eliminating the need for the UI to know the form result ID beforehand.

### 19th of Feb 2025 (v21.18.4)
{.release-note-list}
- **ADDED** Introduced the task lists API for the v4 ticket API, enabling the creation and modification of ticket task lists.  
- **IMPROVED** Enhanced the v4 ticket API to align the `contact` property in the ticket's survey service model with the v4 API style.  
- **IMPROVED** Updated form and form result APIs to format responses based on the `Prefer` request header, allowing requesters to specify whether descriptions should be converted from Markdown to HTML.
- **FIXED** Microsoft OAuth and OpenID authentication now verify users against Azure Tenant verified domains, ensuring that authorized users have emails from verified domains. This prevents users from changing their primary email in Exchange to impersonate others.  
- **IMPROVED** The OAuth and OpenID Authentication API now records invalid emails for a given Microsoft user. An invalid email is one that belongs to an unverified domain.  
- **ADDED** Early release of TECH v2. As we plan to merge the admin portal and TECH portal in the future, it makes sense to introduce a TECH portal-specific route.  
- **IMPROVED** Enhanced server compilation to boost runtime performance by enabling `ServerGC` and ready-to-run compilation, improving garbage collection and cold start times.  
- **FIXED** Fixed GitHub CI/CD for ready-to-run compilation. The GitHub action now runs on `windows-latest` with PowerShell to compress files and uses the Azure PowerShell action to upload them.  

### 4th of Feb 2025 (v21.17.6)
{.release-note-list}
- **ADDED** The ticket object now includes an `author` property to record who created the ticket. Unlike the `CreatedBy` property, which is tied to audit logs, the `author` property strictly reflects business logic. The `CreatedBy` field may record the author indirectly, such as when a ticket is created via an API key, system process, or bot.
- **IMPROVED** Time Entries no longer use the `AssociatedEntity` property. Instead, they now reference the related ticket through the `TicketEntityId` field. The original design was influenced by the ConnectWise system, where time entries could belong to different objects (e.g., meetings). This change reduces technical debt and simplifies system complexity.
- **IMPROVED** The V2 Ticket API now returns a `metadata` field in preparation for the TECH portal UI.
- **IMPROVED** The List Time Entries API now includes ticket information in its response.
- **FIXED** OAuth authentication no longer allows users to log in based on the `OtherMails` property from Microsoft Graph API. The emails stored in `OtherMails` are neither guaranteed to belong to the tenant nor unique within it.
- **IMPROVED** OpenID authentication now verifies emails recorded in the `ProxyAddresses` property of Microsoft Graph API, allowing users to log in using email aliases.
- **FIXED** The HiLo algorithm's max value migration for Request Type now correctly finalizes upon successful completion, preventing it from being re-executed unnecessarily.
- **FIXED** Fixed ticket task created through Power Automate didn't save into database.
- **FIXED** TECH Create ticket API should only allow local agent to use.
- **FIXED** Allow virtual admin to access time entries API.
- **IMPROVED** Enhanced the service model for the find/list time entries API. The ticket reference for each time entry now includes permission details, indicating whether the requester has read or write access.
- **IMPROVED** Added an author property to the communication API's service model. Each community item's associated ticket now includes this property.
- **FIXED** Fixed an issue in the create contact group API where it incorrectly threw an error on the `name` property, even when it was provided in the request payload.

### 30th of Jan 2025 (v21.16.1)
{.release-note-list}
- **FIXED** An issue in Power Automate's form result connector where the committed form result was incorrectly parsed, causing the server to throw an error.  
- **FIXED** The C# generic helper classes `Optional<T>` and `OptionalCollection<T>`, which introduce a third state `undefined` for JSON merge patch, were incorrectly represented in the OpenAPI schema. The schema should now generate for `T` directly instead of the `Optional<T>` wrapper class.  
- **FIXED** When patching a time entry's worked time, the start time is no longer allowed to exceed the time entry's creation time.  
- **ADDED** The legacy v2 API for creating ticket time entries now supports the `ActualHours` property, aligning it with the v4 API.  
- **ADDED** The `EnteredBy` property has been added to the ticket's v2 API service model. This enables the TECH portal to allow agents to edit ticket descriptions if they originally created the ticket.  
- **IMPROVED** The legacy v2 API for creating ticket time entries now uses the v4 APIâ€™s service model validation, ensuring consistent validation logic for start and end times across API versions.  

### 24th of Jan 2025 (v21.15.1)
{.release-note-list}

- **IMPROVED** Adjusted the time entry save functionality to record start and end times with minute-level accuracy instead of millisecond-level accuracy.
