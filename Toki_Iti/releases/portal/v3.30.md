## Ticket Dynamic Content

DeskDirector is constantly looking for new ways to expand our product. Since form dynamic content, you now have another tool at your disposal: ticket dynamic content. The concept of dynamic content is the same: develop your API in accordance with [our specifications](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/4ny9hk9do1), and then our UI will use the information provided by your API to render pre-defined UI components.

Unlike our TECH portal, the client portal implementation has theme improvements. The links and buttons within the content will be themed according to your border selection.
