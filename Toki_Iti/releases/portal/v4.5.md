### AI Assistance

The AI assistance feature is now available in the client portal, enhancing the end-user experience by helping them resolve requests with artificial intelligence. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to search for the most relevant knowledge base articles and presents responses using the AI language model of choice. The goal is to provide accurate answers and efficient assistance, reducing the need for manual intervention.
