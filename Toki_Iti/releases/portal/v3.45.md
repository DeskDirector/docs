## Highlight

## Improve group list

Enhanced User Group Organization: Say goodbye to confusion! In response to feedback, we've overhauled the user group system for clarity and efficiency. The General group is now replaced with a streamlined Group Tickets filter, ensuring tickets are better organized. Additionally, static icons for 'My Tickets' and 'All Tickets' groups simplify identification and differentiate from contact groups, providing a seamless user experience.
