#### AI Enhancements Across Portals
AI-powered assistance is now available across both the TECH and client portals, bringing smarter and more efficient support experiences.
- **Client Portal**: End users can now benefit from AI assistance, which leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find the most relevant knowledge base articles and provide accurate, AI-generated responses. This helps users resolve their requests faster and more effectively.
- **TECH Portal**: Agents now have access to Copilot, which assists in drafting and refining ticket responses. It enables agents to rephrase messages for better clarity or formality and engage in AI-powered conversations for tasks such as summarizing tickets, answering technical questions, or generating task lists—boosting efficiency and productivity.

#### Global API Key & Agent API Key
Previously, the system relied on a single API key for the entire server, granting unrestricted access to all public APIs. With the introduction of Global API Keys and Agent API Keys, users can now create multiple API keys with tailored permissions, specifying whether each key has read-only or read-write access. This enhancement improves security by limiting access and enables tracking of key usage, including monitoring which entity used a key and when it was last used.

#### Time Entries List
With the introduction of the Time Entries List page, users can now view all time entries submitted by agents in one centralized location. Each entry is tied to a service ticket and includes start and end times. This page also powers the Hours Tracked Dashboard, providing a consolidated view of agent activities without the need to access each ticket individually. Available in three locations: current agent view, global view, and individual agent view.

#### Timesheets
Timesheets offer a structured view of time entries by week, broken down by day. This feature provides agents with a clear overview of their weekly activity, including details on time gaps between entries. Additionally, timesheets make it easier to identify overlaps in tracked time, helping agents and managers ensure accuracy and optimize work schedules.

#### Ticket Side Panel
The Ticket Side Panel enhances the user interface by allowing quick access to ticket details without switching to a new tab. Previously, clicking on elements like timesheets, time entries, or surveys would open a new tab with the ticket information. Now, with the Ticket Side Panel, users can view ticket details in a seamless, side-by-side panel, improving workflow and user experience.
