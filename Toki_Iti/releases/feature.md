#### Global API Key & Agent API Key
Previously, the system relied on a single API key for the entire server, granting unrestricted access to all public APIs. With the introduction of Global API Keys and Agent API Keys, users can now create multiple API keys with tailored permissions, specifying whether each key has read-only or read-write access. This enhancement improves security by limiting access and enables tracking of key usage, including monitoring which entity used a key and when it was last used.

With the introduction of the Time Entries List page, users can now view all time entries submitted by agents in one centralized location. Each entry is tied to a service ticket and includes start and end times. This page also powers the Hours Tracked Dashboard, providing a consolidated view of agent activities without the need to access each ticket individually. Available in three locations: current agent view, global view, and individual agent view.

#### Ticket Side Panel
The Ticket Side Panel enhances the user interface by allowing quick access to ticket details without switching to a new tab. Previously, clicking on elements like timesheets, time entries, or surveys would open a new tab with the ticket information. Now, with the Ticket Side Panel, users can view ticket details in a seamless, side-by-side panel, improving workflow and user experience.
