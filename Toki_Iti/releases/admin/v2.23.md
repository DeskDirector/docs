### Effortless Bulk Import for Contacts and Agents via CSV

We are excited to introduce a powerful new feature: bulk import of contacts and agents using CSV files. This enhancement is designed to streamline onboarding and make large-scale updates faster and easier than ever.

#### How It Works
- **Flexible CSV Structure:** Upload a CSV file (up to 5 MB) with columns separated by commas (`,`). We recommend including a header row for clarity.
- **Custom Column Mapping:** During import, you can map your CSV columns to key fields: email (required), full name, given name, surname, and title. Either full name or given name must be provided.
- **Import Modes:** Choose between creating new entries only or creating and updating existing contacts/agents based on their email address.
- **Account-Specific Imports:** Contacts can be imported directly under a specific account, ensuring accurate organization.
- **Smart Matching & Updates:** The system identifies existing contacts or agents by their email address. If a match is found and any mapped field has changed, the entry is updated. Otherwise, a new contact or agent is created. Contacts are unique per account by email; agents are unique globally by email.

#### Benefits
- **Rapid Onboarding:** Seamlessly add entire teams or customer lists in just a few clicks.
- **Mass Updates:** Effortlessly update information for multiple contacts or agents at once.
- **Error Reduction:** Automatic matching by email helps prevent duplicate entries and ensures data consistency.
