# 24th of Feb 2025 (version 2.16)

{.release-note-list}
- **FIXED** Resolved time range conversion issues in the UI by using `date-fns` for calculations, ensuring proper handling of daylight saving time.  
- **IMPROVED** Enhanced the styling of GitHub task list items in markdown, ensuring they blend well with existing `ul` and `ol` list styles.  
- **ADDED** The ticket service model now includes an `author` property, allowing the UI to display the correct author of the original ticket description instead of defaulting to the ticket owner.  
- **IMPROVED** Refined the ticket list page's order dropdown. Users now first select a sorting criterion (e.g., name, creation time, last modified time) and then choose the sorting order (ascending or descending). This reduces the total number of options from `2x` to `x+2`, making the dropdown less cluttered.  
- **ADDED** Introduced a ticket preview panel, enabling various UI components—such as surveys, time entry lists, and timesheets—to open a ticket panel when associated with a specific ticket.  
- **IMPROVED** Enhanced the ticket preview attachment dialog. Previously, the TECH portal could only display one attachment at a time; now, users can navigate through attachments without closing the dialog.  
- **IMPROVED** The attachment preview dialog now supports text file previews, including `scss`, `css`, `html`, `TypeScript`, `PowerShell`, and more.  
- **IMPROVED** Streamlined the left-side navigation by grouping related features under a "Features" category for better organization.
