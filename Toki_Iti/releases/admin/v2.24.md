## Highlights

### Contacts and Account Contacts Improvements

The contact list UI was previously based on a legacy API, limiting available filtering options. With the adoption of the new v4 API, you can now:

- Filter contacts by client portal access, role (manager, VIP, approver), and feature settings.
- Easily identify contacts with specific configurations and perform bulk modifications.

These enhancements make it significantly easier to manage and update contacts according to your needs. Screenshots can be provided to illustrate the new filtering capabilities.
