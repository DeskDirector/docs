## Highlights

We're thrilled to announce that Toki Iti admin portal 2.27 marks a pivotal moment in our evolution toward the future TECH portal v2. This release introduces a completely refactored ticket page - the heart of our ticketing system - built on modern Angular architecture that delivers enhanced security, performance, and user experience while laying the foundation for our next-generation platform.

### ðŸŽ¯ Revolutionary Ticket Page Experience

The centerpiece of this release is our completely reimagined ticket page, rebuilt from the ground up using modern Angular technology. By moving away from AngularJS, we've unlocked powerful new capabilities including enhanced security through AOT compilation, eliminating the need for inline scripts that previously posed security risks.

This isn't just a visual refresh - it's a fundamental transformation of how you interact with tickets. The new interface seamlessly integrates with other parts of the system, allowing you to open tickets in off-canvas panels without losing your place in timesheets or other workflows. Smart tooltips now provide instant access to detailed contact, agent, and account information with clickable actions right at your fingertips - no more navigating away from your current task just to check a phone number or email address.

While we're still implementing some advanced features (ticket creation, task management, and form attachments are coming soon), the current experience already delivers significant improvements in comment management, time logging, and multi-property editing that will streamline your daily workflow.

### ðŸ”„ Seamless Contact Relocation with Full Control

Managing contact relationships just became incredibly flexible with our new contact relocation feature. You now have complete control when moving contacts between accounts, with the intelligent option to decide the fate of their associated tickets.

Whether you need to transfer a contact along with their entire ticket history or move them while reassigning their tickets to another contact, this feature puts the power of choice in your hands. This capability addresses one of the most complex scenarios in customer relationship management, ensuring that no ticket gets lost in transition and business continuity remains intact during organizational changes.
