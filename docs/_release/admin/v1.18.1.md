# Highlights

## Webhook setting page

## Webhook security

Security is always one of our top priority. We have implemented HMAC hash to help with security concer ever since our webhook beta period. Somehow, the capability has not been exposed or explained in our knowledge base.

With latest change, you can find webhook security under [form security page](/portal/forms/webhook-security) and [webhook setting page](/advanced/webhooks).
