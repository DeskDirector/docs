# Highlights

## Audit Logs
One of the most frequently requested features is audit logs. The feature itself necessitates a significant amount of effort across the entire product. We included logs for settings that frequently resulted in support tickets in this admin portal release. We will continue to add more logs in the future.

* Authentication logs - System/Authentication/Audit logs (dropdown)
* Contact related auth logs - Portal/Auth Audit Logs
* Company logs - Portal/Companies/Company/Audit Logs
* Contact logs - Portal/Companies/Company/Contacts/Contact/Audit logs
* Member logs - TECH/Members/Member/Audit logs

## Storage Statistics
We've added new storage usage statistics to help customers understand how much resource has been allocated to their service. Since the introduction of the native file system and DeskDirector for Microsoft, we may be able to implement metered billing for storage usage.

## Pagination UI improvement
The majority of our user interfaces are responsive, which means that users can use our product on any device. The pagination UI component allows the user to navigate through a long list. When the count is too high, the existing implementation does not display well on small devices.

We changed the design to make it more mobile friendly.

## Advanced Theme improvement
We've noticed some issues with the advanced theme setting UI since the release of the brand package. When a custom variable's colour is set, the expanded group collapses. As a result, the UI is difficult to use. The colour picker is also difficult to use because there is no indication of what the user can type in. All of these issues have been addressed in this admin portal release.
