# Highlights

## Brand package

Many of our customers have asked for a way to set at the company level since the release of the email delivery account. We are now able to cover this scenario and extend other capabilities on top of it thanks to the brand package feature release.

- The host's brand settings have been moved to the brand package. Depending on your requirements, you can add or remove setup.
- Brand package setup has taken the place of company branding. Your settings will be transferred automatically by the system.

> Brand packages are only available on server 19.55. It is scheduled to be released in the Oceanic region on February 16th, and the rest of the world on February 21st. 

To get started. Navigate to the admin portal and look under the system category for brand packages.

## User groups

Since the release of user groups, our customers have requested a method to determine which user groups a given contact has access to. You can now access it through any contact. Our user interface also allows you to switch between user groups and user pages.
