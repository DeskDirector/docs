# 3rd of Feb 2021 (version 1.20)

- **ADDED** Ticket survey is now available

# Highlights

## Survey (Dynamic Subscription, DeskDirector Pro/Enterprise subscription or Early adopter only)

Survey is a new feature we have bringing into our system. You can design ticket survey under Survey menu. Once enabled, DeskDirector ticket email for ticket closed event will be able to display **Take Survey** link button.

User will be able to take survey inside client portal.

Admin portal provides survey result analytics, which can help you review customer feedback. In the future, we will allow ticket survey analytics to be available in TECH portal, similar as service radar.

Currently, survey is not available for essential subscription, and we don't have any schedule on when we will allow essential subscription to use it.

Currently, functionality we have for survey are:
* Allow default survey or board overwrite for survey definition
* Allow one question per ticket survey
* Support both CSAT question or NPS question
* Provide surve analytics for last 30 days, per month.
* Provide question analytics for last 30 days, per month.
* Provide different score calculation for NPS or CSAT question.
* Allow view survey result

Features that we are planned
* Notification when receive negative feedback
* Display analytics inside TECH portal. Not only allow admin but also member to view survey result.
* Allow display feedback for current technician.
* Custom Survey and survey campaign to collect general feedback that's not related to a specific ticket. You can have maximum of 5 questions for such survey. (Still under development, no estimate)
