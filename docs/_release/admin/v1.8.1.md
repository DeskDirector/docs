## Email delivery history
We always proud that we have different ways to deliver email, but one of issue we always have was the ability to diagnose mail delivery. Recently, our system start to record email delivery and now you can browse through history at [here](/system/emails/delivery).

If record page has reported successful delivery but end user didn't receive, then it is most likely related to spam settings.

## Service Radar
We first introduced [Service Radar](/analytics/service-radar) 6 years ago in HUD(heath up and display, legacy windows client that's similar to TECH). Many of our customer loves it. It was a common request to bring it back to our new platform.

In this admin console release, we have reintroduced it. The reason to introduce inside admin console is the intention of the product. Most of time, it is a tool for manager to discover staggering tickets.

In the future, we will be looking at bring it to TECH. We do not have any estimate delivery time on that yet.

Service radar compare to the legacy one, it now gains auto reload capability. We set it up to automatically refresh every 5 min. That means you can leave it on a screen that it can update itself automatically.

We have also added full screen mode on top of that.
