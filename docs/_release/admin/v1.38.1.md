# Highlights

## Workflow Improvements

We've noticed a number of issues as more customers begin to use the workflow feature. We are here to address them in this major release.

- You can now create up to 100 workflows in the admin portal, though the previous limits still apply if you use Power Automate to create workflows (up to 50 workflows).
- The workflow list interface now uses a different colour to display workflow without action. As a result, we make it easier for you to identify and remove them. 
- Power Automate workflows can now be deleted from the admin portal. The actual flow must still be manually disabled or deleted in the Azure portal.
- We implemented a UI to display workflows that are currently loaded as a result of server-side workflow engine improvements.

## New notification configuration page

The new [notification configuration](/configs/portal/notifications/basic) is now available, and the UI should be much easier to use than our previous implementation.

## Improvement on text field's maximum width condition

More options in the form editor have been added to assist our customers in setting up common sentence length validation. For instance, 64, 128, and 256 for customers who needed them for Active Directory.

## New breadcrumb layout

Previously, long breadcrumb navigators did not render well on mobile devices. We have now improved the style to make it suitable for both desktop and mobile screens. 

We do not guarantee that the admin portal will be functional on mobile devices, but we do our best to make 95% of the pages mobile-friendly.
