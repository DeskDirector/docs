## New chart for current month portal and BiggerBrains usage

## Ticket life cycle event for email notification
Since release of email notification, one of setting confused our customer is ignore status inside ticket event. For ticket open, updated, closed event, they are determined by our system automatically without setting required. They are not status related. Other than change template, you don't have to do anything.

Ignore status list is only useful when you have situation where there are multiple close status, and some of them need to be ignored. 

e.g. Status: closed, closed (spam), closed (no email), do not send closed email when status is on `closed (spam)` or `closed (no email)`. 

We have now marked ignore status as advanced setting and hide it by default.

## OneNote notebook publish cycle
Since release of notebook integration, one of common issue is customer forgot to publish change. In this iteration, we have changed approach. Instead of showing action button, we display proper integration graph to describe how OneNote integration works. Hopefully customer is able to pick up the mechanism of feature by looking at graph.

## Ticket Diagnose
We often receive support request regarding why is given ticket not accessible by certain user. Since there are many fact involved, it is not a simple question of can or cannot.

In this admin release, we have released diagnose page to help our customer, so they cam help themselves.

You can access this diagnose page by navigate into contact page. (Portal => Companies => Contacts => Contact => Diagnose) or (Portal => Contacts => Contact => Diagnose).
