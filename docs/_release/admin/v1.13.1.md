# Highlights

## Test mode for ticket email event
With introduce of DeskDirector email notification, our customer was struggling on missing test mode. To give everyone confidence to try out new feature, in this admin portal release, we now have test mode.

Test mode can enable per event per board/queue. When enabled, email belong to that event should send to specified email instead.

## Broadcasts available for email template
It is important to notify end user when there are important notifications, this is intention of broadcast. Instead of push notification to our portal, broadcast is now available to our ticket email event. You can use Liquid template to display it in ticket email or it can be displayed automatically when you use DeskDirector system default email template for ticket email event.

## Member/resource additional role
Ever since we turned off access to broadcast for regular member on TECH, many customer report of difficult to use. The original change was for hot fix to address some of customer's concern for regular member to broadcast.

With this admin portal release, we now introduced a new role specifically for this scenario. Member can assign to `advanced` role. That role can allow them to see broadcast in TECH.

## Menu item's sandbox
Extension page is popular choice to extend capability of portal, we also introduced HTML5's sandbox alongside with it, to help our customer to secure their website. Sandbox itself is hard to understand unless you are familiar with front-end development. That's the reason we introduced helper when we released menu item.

There was issue with display of this helper, it was too subtle for customer to notice. We have now improved visual apperance of the dropdown helper, people should now find it much easier to configure.
