# Highlights

## Synchronization

Since the Autotask integration, DeskDirector has used synchronisation to cache data. We've always had the ability to force resynchronisation, but it was never made public until now. This is because resync is expensive. With the release of the audit log feature, we can expose such a capability and use the audit log to track who initiated resync.

You can monitor sync state and initiate resync on fields starting with server version 19.75.1. For large data tables, please contact our support team, who will assist you with initialising resync. This feature is only available for ConnectWise and Autotask integration.
