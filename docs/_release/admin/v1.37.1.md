## Ticket Dynamic Content

DeskDirector is constantly looking for new ways to expand our product. Since form dynamic content, you now have another tool at your disposal: ticket dynamic content. The concept of dynamic content is the same: develop your API in accordance with [our specifications](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/4ny9hk9do1), and then our UI will use the information provided by your API to render pre-defined UI components.

You can check out [our specifications](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/4ny9hk9do1). The setting for TECH or client portal is under following locations. The ticket dynamic content for the client portal will be available within the next week or two.

- TECH => Settings => Advanced
- System => Feature Configuration => Advanced
