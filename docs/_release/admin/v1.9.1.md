## Contact list improvements
In this release, we have revisited contact list to improves the user experience. 

Previous, filter's wording is very technical. Such as `configs`. Also, permission filter also looks funny, what does that mean? We have now reword those filter, to ensure easier to understand. Permissions filter also been changed to optional filter. It will only display when filter by permissions overwrite been selected.

On top of filter change, we also have experimental feature on contact list. We have added gravatar support there. List will display gravatar's avatar as default, overwrite if user have uploaded their avatar locally.

Whether we will support gravatar in the future is still under debate. The problem with gravatar is default image seems noisy.

## Ensure VIP priority
This setting is under `System`>`Feature Configuration`>`Tickets`. Our customer often enabled that without knowning what's that is for. VIP priority itself is simple, when VIP create ticket through DeskDirector portal, portal will set ticket priority to that VIP priority.

The problem with `Ensure VIP Priority` is that, it is not the tool to enable VIP priority. But it is enhancement. It will ensure any ticket belong to VIP will always under VIP priorit.It is very specific scenario. Many of our customer find that to be annoying. Since, they don't want VIP's ticket to be always on that priority. It is case by case scenario.

Hope with that help text, it can help user to decide whether this is for them.
