### Permission filtering for [contact list](/portal/contacts)
It is always hard to figure out who is approver from contact list, in this release we have added permission filtering to the contact list. When any permission been ticked, contact who have permission override and with those ticket permission will display. For permissions that's inherit from parent level, this filtering will not apply.

### System about panel
To help customer understand the system version of their platform, we have introduced about panel. You can launch it from your user dropdown at top left side of admin portal.

### Reverse relationship information for [Form](/system/forms)
Form improved information gathering for request type system. But until now, it was hard to figure out a given form is used by which request type. In this release, admin portal now display count inside form list and also have dedicate page to display request types.

### Form's sections editor
Since new form editor released through admin portal v2. We have introduced capability to duplicate form section and order sections. But the interface was not easy to use, the behaviour is not as what our customer expected.

We have now made necessary change to the form sections, which I will list below.
* Section creation now no longer navigate to section itself, but put it on focus to allow change name and re-ordering.
* Base section now selectable but not allowed on change name or add condition.
* Base section now can be cloned.
* Condition and edit button now inside dropdown, similar to field focus UI.

### Form's section editor
Form section editor had pagination at bottom for navigate between sections. To make navigation easier on long section, we have now added subtle navigation link at top of page.
