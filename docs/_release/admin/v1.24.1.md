## Catch all company for contact creation

Contact auto creation by mail token, active directory or OAuth now have improvements. In the past, only company with email domain can allow contact auto creation, with this catch all company feature, system is able to create contact under catch all company even if the email domain has not been registered with any company.

You can find this setting under [Feature Configuration](/configs/system/feature-config/contacts).

## Clone request type

Our old request type admin interface allows user to clone existing request type. With introduction of new UI, such capability was not available at the release. With admin portal 1.24 release, we have added it back.

Compare to the old implementation, new clone feature only allow clone one request type at time but with additional feature. Where it now allow you to clone tag setting and also specify the name and category for new request type.

If you are old customer, you can now apply single request type for a specific company or contact with ease.

If you are new customer, you can setup global request type group and without understanding of how filter system works.
