## Multiple email delivery methods
You can now create multiple email delivery methods and use them under different scenarios. We have also added SendGrid integration, this is a new addition to existing setting.

- Attach email delivery account to board. You can use this for different communication channel. Such as sales@example.com
- Attach email delivery account to host setting. In this way, you can register additional custom domain, where it covers company merge scenario. Technician can still work under default domain, where joined new customers can access client portal from their original MSP's host.
- Attach host setting to company. Pair with host setting, allow ticket email notification to use branding and email delivery method from host setting.

**Q:** How come company branding been deprecated?  
**A:** Company branding is not align with login page's logo. Up to this stage, compare to host level branding, we are not sure how much value it brings. On the other hand, it is always good to simplify the system. Too many setting override can support more scenarios, but on the other hand, it is hard to use. Are we able to cover 80~90% of use case and still keep system simple is one of measurement we are using.

**Q:** We use company level branding for streamline IT. Are we able to assign email delivery method directly to company?  
**A:** In latest release, we didn't cover such scenario. The problem is when align with login page. When you login, you receive mail token email from your MSP email domain, where ticket notification will use different email domain. Something feel a bit off there. Login page's branding is also different to what they are getting once logged in. We are looking into this but no guarantee at this stage.

**Q:** When we use host level branding. Do our technicians have to use TECH portal under different domain?  
**A:** No. You don't have to. Even though there are several host setting, they all connect to same base setting, same PSA account. You can work on tickets from your desired host.
