- **ADDED** Task list template now able to mark as for internal use

# Highlights

## Task List

The task list has been an excellent way to establish pending tasks for a given ticket and track the task list's progress. The use case has been limited because it is also visible to the end user. We expanded the functionality of the task list to allow it to be used for internal operations. You can now mark the intention of a task template in the admin portal; when a task list is created in the TECH portal or a request type, the default choice of the task template is respected.
