# Highlights

## License Certificate

We have previously introduced Chargify and Stripe integration to completely transition away from the legacy local licence system. We now have a new licence certificate system in place to cover servers that are either internal or not paid for through Chargify or Stripe. If a server does not have a licence, they will be unable to use our product; please contact our support if you have a licence issue.
