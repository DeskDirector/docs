As we seek out solution with ConnectWise, we want to provide our customer with choice. With new interface, you can choose between accurate author of the note or initial email contains description.

## BiggerBrains improvements
Existing delivery of BiggerBrains has its limitation, your voice is loud and clear. In this new implementation we want improve the experience on following topics.
* Optimize the experience on purchase and deployment. You should have your BiggerBrains courses available right after purchase and immediately. No wait or procedure is required.
* Additional course product. Previous, we only had office and windows related courses. We have now added BiggerBrains product for other courses they provide. Such as accounting, management, writing etc.
* Added search capability, user can now search for courses they are interested at.
* Added course preview image, improve the visualization.
* Added tags for each course, allow future facet capability. e.g. how many courses for excel.
* Provide capability of future extendability. One of area we want to expand to is record. Allow our application to answer question such as who has watched courses, who watched most etc. (This is not there)

## Contact permission for ConnectWise default contact.

For ConnectWise, we had hidden rule for default contact. It was implemented at begining of this product. It is not obvioius for customer to figure that out. For default contact of company, they automatically gain all tickets capability.

We now have this displayed in the admin portal interface. This is attempt to resolve the confusion our customer had.
