# Highlights

## You can now select next year holiday when close to end of the year.

When close to end of the year, you can now navigate to next year's holidays page and able to modify them. Our system will auto populate holidays based on your country and region selection, but it is still wise to go through them, and remove anything that is not relevant.

## Change form field or choice's identifier

You can now change identifier of choice or field. Choice is unique by field, where field is unique by form. Such capability allow you to make automation easier. For example, different form can have same ID field and choices. Then the logic is much easier to extract result of submitted form on same meaning fields.

## Early trigger for ticket survey

You can now setup early trigger point for ticket survey per board/queue. Once setup, instead of ask for feedback after ticket is closed, system will send out notification when ticket changed to a specific status.

## New external link menu item

Client portal in the past use server API to check whether given URL can be embedded. With latest client portal release, we no longer support that. We encourage customer to change any page cannot be embedded to external link menu. When end user click on such menu item, client portal will prompt the link into new tab/window.

Such change is due to the cost on detect whether page can be embedded. By remove it, external page will be render 200% faster. External page was also never designed for page cannot be embedded. Thus, this is not breaking change.

In the past, around 2013 website can be disabled from embed by `X-Frame` HTTP header. In past 9 years, there are more options been introduced to disable embed content. Below are common way of disable embed and the issue with detect embed capability.

* Use CSP (Content security policy) header to specify who can embed current page. 
* X-Frame to disable embed
* X-Frame to only allow same origin to be embedded
* X-Frame to only allow certain origin to be embedded.
* Many page's pre-flight request has different response compare to actual page. e.g. MSFT knowledge page, pre-flight request says no embed, where actual page allows embed.
