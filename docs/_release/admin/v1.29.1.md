# Highlights

## Batch modify tags
As tag became one of key feature of DeskDirector, our developer team is well aware of the challenge our customer is facing when they try to maintain tags for multiple entities. When we implement company, contact and member list, bulk has been on roadmap from begining. Now, we finally have chance to implement it.

You can now bulk edit tags for companies and contacts. Include append tags, remove tags, replace tags and reset tags.
