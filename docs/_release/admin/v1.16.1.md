# Highlights

## Mechanism to detect ticket deletion.
Ticket deleted from PSA was an known issue. Since the limitation of sync process, we are unable to detect deletion automatically in the past. Lately, we have added two mechanism to help in such case.

1. Daily and weekly digest to reverse check and find out deleted tickets. This applies to Autotask and ConnectWise. Operation is hold at each server region's midnight. This digest will be enabled by default with server 18.133.1.
2. Advanced detection through ConnectWise's webhook. This requires to enable manually. Autotask does not have webhook for ticket event yet, until it is available, this is ConnectWise only feature.

## Search helper
Different ordinary enterprise software, where search is based on SQL's contains query. Our search is [full-text search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-text_search). We have also written [knowledge base article](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/09gt8a3cb2) to further explain how its been implemented.

In admin portal, we have added help dropdown to assist user.

## Member / Resource configuration page
Since introduce of new admin portal, member management was one of often used page that's still not yet convert over. During this release, we have re-implemented inside our modern admin portal. It also introduced several new mechanism.

* Added capability to modify tags
* Added capability to remove avatar
* Avoid display API member for ConnectWise. (Autotask API resource indicator is dynamic ID, we are unable to securely identify exactly ID to use for filtering)
* Validation guard for company and board/queue restriction. ConnectWise's streamline IT will require both restriciton.
