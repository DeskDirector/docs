## Customizable colour for client portal
Allow customize colour for client portal was one of the top voted [user voice](https://github.com/DeskDirector/UserVoice/issues/77). Since the technical difficulty when combine with normal theme, it was delayed until now. 

We are slowly move away from Google's material theme, as such it opens up opportunity for us to achieve many things we cannot before.

For people who is familiar with front end development, you may ask what's wrong with material theme. There is nothing wrong with it, the difficulty was related to the material theme library we were using. Which contains many anti-pattern and cause difficult to customize. It is an low hanging fruit to introduce theme through material UI, but it is an software technical debt when you want to scale the functionality.

Through this admin portal and client portal release, you can now modify many component of the client portal. We may progressively add more options in the future when it makes sense.

At the time of this release, we have exposed following components for customziation.

* Top navigation bar
* Main menu's active state
* Primary button
* Primary outline button
* Primary colour palette (as base point for many components inside client portal)

You can either choose colour by provide [hash colour value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet) or search for colours from predefined list.

## Simplified colour theme
In the past, we allow you to choose primary colour, accent colour and warning colour. Which often cause confusion. Such as when will accent colour been used? What should I do with warning colour? Are there danger colour?

As we start to remove material UI and its theme, we have redefined standard.

* There are two colour code, primary and secondary
* Secondary colour will be gray
* Warning colour will be yellow
* Danger colour will be red

We will try to limit the place we will use warning and danger, but they should have its common meaning. We should not give warning or danger a purple colour. That's not what user expected.

If your colour brand is red or yellow, you should think about whether you want to use red or yellow for navigation colour. Such colour will cause psychology impact. 

For example, even though Youtube is red theme, do they use red everywhere? The answer is no. They only use red when necessary, not all over the place. Often, the brand colour has already been used inside logo, which is enough, you should choose the colour that's go alongside with red or yellow.
