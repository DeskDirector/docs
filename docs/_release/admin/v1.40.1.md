# Highlights

## Email Template

One of the goals of this admin portal release was to make the DeskDirector email system more user-friendly. Instead of using the import functionality in a custom email template, you can now use any system template directly inside the email event settings.

Aside from the ability to select any system email template, the most recent server release also included a new Liquid filter. The new filter enables us to convert ticket notes to HTML for a more professional appearance within the email client.

All ticket-related system templates have been updated to use the new filter. If you're using a custom email template, you can import it from the system template again or use the filter directly.

To use new filter, you can according to following Liquid filter example.

```

{{ Item.Note | MarkdownToHtml }}

{{ FeaturedNote.Note | MarkdownToHtml }}

```

If the image has been formatted according to the Markdown spec, the new Markdown to HTML filter allows you to render it directly. The system does not enable it by default; you must use a custom template to accomplish this. The reason for this is that outlook for Windows does not support max-width, making responsive image display impossible. 

```
{{ Item.Note | MarkdownToHtml: "showImage" }}

{{ FeaturedNote.Note | MarkdownToHtml: "showImage" }}

```

## Upcoming email template improvements

We intend to release more custom Liquid filters in order to provide more system email templates for various scenarios. All existing email templates are designed in the ConnectWise or Autotask style; the new style we want to introduce is more modern. It is focused on the user who added the comment and does not display the timeline. When you don't have a client portal, timeline is useful, but when you have an easily accessible client platform, there's no need to add extra noise. 

Once the associated server is released next week, you can use the following custom Liquid filter to change the size of your avatar or image. 

```

<mj-image src="{{ FeaturedNote.User.Avatar | AvatarSize: 160 }}" width="160px" />

<mj-image width="100px" align="center" src="{{ Branding.Logo.Url | ImgSize: 100, 100, 'fill' }}" />

<mj-image width="100px" align="center" src="{{ Branding.Logo.Url | ImgSize: 100, 100, 'fillmax' }}" />

```

## Tag enhancement

The tag system is an unrestricted way to categorise entities; you do not need to define anything before using it. However, dealing with typos is difficult. You can now predefine tags in this release. The UI will then provide suggestion when you want to filter list by tags or add tags to any entities.

Tag type is used to instruct the UI on the tag's intent. The UI will only show related tags by default, and will then use tag type to provide better suggestions when the user types in. 

- `generic`: when tag without any type. It will display under any entity
- `service`: Ticket, task templates, survey, request type, request group, form, workflow, email template
- `company`: Company, user group, form, menu item, menu group, request type, request group, survey, task template, email template, workflow
- `contact`: Contact, user group, form, menu item, menu group, request type, request group, survey, task template, email template, workflow
- `agent`: Agent, workflow, email template

## Improved list state display

As our newly created UI improves, we'd like to apply it to the old UI as well in this release. We begin with the list because it is used throughout the admin portal. Previously, many of the primary lists only had one state. Which is to show the item if there is one. We are now present in five different states. 

- List: Display items
- No items existed: Display welcome message
- Empty search or filter result: Display empty message with option to remove filter
- Initial loading: No items has been fetched and UI is busy.
- Unexpected: When list not exist and UI is not busy. Such state often happen when API throws error.
