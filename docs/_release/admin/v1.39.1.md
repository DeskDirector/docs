# Highlights

## Stripe Invoices

Some of our customers experienced subscription payment issues as a result of Europe's implementation of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). You can now view invoices or update payment method in the admin portal to assist them in adjusting the payment method or paying the cost manually.

If you pay with Stripe and have recently had a payment issue, go to the invoice list, click on the invoice with the payment issue, and then pay the cost through the **Stripe** hosted invoice page. 

We have no plans to create an invoices page for customers who pay with Chargify. We are gradually migrating customers to Stripe.

## Ticket list page (BETA)

We intend to merge the TECH portal and the admin portal in the future. If you are using DeskDirector for Microsoft, you now have access to the new [tickets page](/tickets).

We do not have an estimate at this time because the merger plan is set for the next two to three years. The page is created by our developer outside of office hours. They will not be given high priority for any issue or feature request.

The following are the enhancements over the TECH portal.

* The rendering speed has increased significantly. The UI rendering engine was to blame for the delay in pagination in the TECH portal. 
* With the new page design, the mobile experience has been dramatically improved. 
* You can now share your browser link with others, and they will arrive at the same page with the same filter and pagination. 
* The dark theme is now supported on this page.

## Signature Field in DeskDirector form

Some of our customers are required to obtain their clients' signatures. You can now do so using the DeskDirector form. DeskDirector managed storage will be used to store the signature. Similarly to the file field, we do not intend to save within PSA.

## Form JSON editor

To assist our customer in easily backing up and restoring form definitions in Git. JSON editor has been implemented. We still recommend that you use a proper form editor; the JSON editor is best suited for exporting and restoring definitions.
