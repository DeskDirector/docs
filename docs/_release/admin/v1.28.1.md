## Workflow
As we have announced on version 1.27 release, workflow is now general available to customer who has this feature in their subscription. You can check account page under admin portal to view all the features that available.

Workflow provided native event and filter to help you build automation. Our DeskDirector Power Automate connectors has also released in Microsoft Store which you can use.

With workflow, you can easily achieve following scenarios.
- When ticket switched board/queue, perform action.
- When ticket's company or contact changed, perform action
- When tag add to or removed from ticket perform action
- When ticket changed to high priority, perform action
- When ticket received at out of office hour, perform action
- When agent or user comment on ticket, perform action.
- When chat is received outside of office hour, perform action.

At moment, we only have one action, which is webhook. You can use Microsoft Power Automate for that, which allow you to send message to Teams, through email, or mobile text.
