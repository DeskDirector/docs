## TECH Portal Dashboard

Our product includes a TECH portal as an optional feature. We have not yet charged customers who paid with Stripe due to the feature's promotion. This will change on June 1st. The TECH portal metered billing will be based on the billing usage of the TECH portal.

The billing usage of the TECH portal is determined by how an agent modifies a ticket or uses chat. The cost will be determined by what you have signed up for.
