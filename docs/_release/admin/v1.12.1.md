# Highlights

## Host setting
How to make login page different for different scenario. In the past, we had company brand, but that only apply to logo and theme after end user logged into portal. 

With latest admin portal release, you can now configure setting based on server DNS. This feature only works for customer who have multiple domain setup.

## Ticket global events toggle
In the past, you can turn off approval and request more info emails under **System** => **Feature Configuration** => **Tickets**. 

With introduction of email notification system, those flags are more align with the new feature. Thus, we have moved them to new location. Also allow to toggle different approval email separately.

## New email setting section
As we add more and more configurations for email system. It make sense for it to have it's own group. That way, user can easily find the setting they are interested at.
