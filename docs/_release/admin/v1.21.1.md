# Highlights

## Custom Survey Editor
We are continue to adding more capacity to our survey system. The new feature is called as custom survey. It can be used inside email broadcast. Where you can send survey using email broadcast to your selected client.

You can have maximum of 5 survey questions for custom survey. Each time, end user submit survey response, it is saved into an result pool. In case of email broadcast, it is called as email campaign. 

TECH portal is able to select custom survey when creating email broadcast.

## New Navigation System
In this release, we have implemented new navigation system, which is to help admin portal to be used under smaller device. Currently not all admin page are mobile friendly. But majority of them should be iPad ready. 

Our long term vision is to merge TECH portal and admin portal.

## Admin portal menu search
From this release, we have also introduced new capability to search for the admin page you are interested at. It uses full text search based on the name of the page and the context of the page. It does not have capability to search content of the page.

## Dark Theme
There are few admin page has now changed to dark theme capable. People who enabled dark theme for their browser should have this automatically enabled.

The page that will be shared with TECH portal should allow for dark theme.

Currently supported dark theme pages are.

* Service Radar
* Survey Designer
* Survey Result Analyzer
* Error Log dialog

## Restricted Access to Admin portal

One of the common request from our customer is restrict access to admin portal. In the past, only master admin can access admin portal. It only has one level of access. With this admin portal release, we now allow technician to be assigned as admin. That way they can access admin portal for end user experience management. 

Such role is good for company's customer success position.

As admin role, technician will have less access than master admin.
