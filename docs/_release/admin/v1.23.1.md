## Combine menu group and menu item pages

Inside admin portal, both menu group and menu item pages are for menu system feature. The separation cause confusion, where user may think they are separate feature. Within this release, we have addressed issue by merge both together.

## Survey Results Export

System now support export survey's result as CSV. We have two CSV format, one of them is suitable for excel, where the other is suitable for PowerBI. The difference is how we split data into different columns.

You can export it either through our admin portal interface or through export link itself, with additional filtering and unrestricted time range.

From image below, the export is for last 30 days. Where you can change the time range filter to allow different export result.

## Request Type bulk action

In the old request type UI, we had functionality to copy setting from one type to others. The problem with that approach is completely mimic. There are often minor difference between each request type. Such issue cause bulk copy setting feature not been utilized.

With redesigned type list, we now allow bulk editing by alternation, rather than mimic. You can select multiple request types then either allow one company to access them or disallow that company to access them. System will go through types individually and apply appropriate modification.
