# Highlights

## User group

Last year, DeskDirector implemented [group tag permission](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/zt9zs2y5rl) for tickets. It was the starting point for user group. It had good intention but was implemented in a rush.

With latest client portal release and this admin portal release, you now have a new tool in your disposal. You can take read on this feature at our [knowledgebase](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/bxd7i1kkw3).

As for group tag, it has been deprecated and will be removed by end of this year. We will look into auto migration for existing customer who is using it.

## Access to Site permission
With release of user group, we have altered behaviour of ConnectWise site permission. New behaviour is anyone with the permission can see site as user group. On top of that, this permission was available only at contact level before, now it is available at company level.
