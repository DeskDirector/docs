# Highlights

## User group

Last year, DeskDirector implemented [group tag permission](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/zt9zs2y5rl) for tickets. It was the starting point for user group. It had good intention but was implemented in a rush.

With latest client portal release and this admin portal release, you now have a new tool in your disposal. You can take read on this feature at our [knowledgebase](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/bxd7i1kkw3).

As for group tag, it has been deprecated and will be removed by end of this year. We will look into auto migration for existing customer who is using it.
