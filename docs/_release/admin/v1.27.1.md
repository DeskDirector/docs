# Highlights

## OneNote notebook for user group
OneNote notebook can be assigned to client portal's menu item before, which provided static content for your customer. But unless it is public content, there is often need for scoped content. When you want to only release content for a specific client, or group of users, menu item is kind of hard to achieve.

With introduce of user group, you can now assign notebook to user group, which it became scoped content environment. Once assigned, notebook can be viewed as static page under client portal's user group.

## Workflows (upcoming)
This is sneak peek for upcoming feature **Workflows**. DeskDirector server has been supporting webhooks for several years. Customer can utilize it for automation with great success. But we never satisfied with it, there are more we can do.

Here are goals we would like to achieve with workflows.
* Simplify the webhook content, make it easier to work with under different environment.
* Server local filter to decrease the cost of Automation processer. Such as Power Automate (MSFT) or Zapier.
* Detailed record to help diagnose workflow
* Simplified automation with Power Automate (MSFT).

We will release our own connector in Power Automate's market, you can create workflow either through Power Automate or from admin portal. Currently we have been working with Microsoft on initial release of our connector. We will keep you informed once we have released it.
