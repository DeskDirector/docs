- **ADDED** Allow assign OneNote notebook to user group.

# Highlights

## OneNote notebook for user group
OneNote notebook can be assigned to client portal's menu item before, which provided static content for your customers. However, there were instances that scoped access to a notebook was needed, specially when you want to only release content for specific client(s), or group of users. This was difficult to achieve in the custom menu items.

With the introduction of user group, it made creating a scoped content environment easier. With this release, it is now possible to assign a specific notebook to user groups. Once assigned, the notebook can be viewed as static page under client portal's user group.

## Workflows (upcoming)
This is sneak peek for an upcoming feature called **Workflows**. DeskDirector has supported webhooks for several years and customers have utilized it for automation with great success. However, we were never satisfied with it and knew there are more we can do. 

Here are the goals we would like to achieve with Workflows:
- Simplify the webhook content, making it easier to work with under different environments. 
- Server local filter to decrease the cost of Automation processors, such as Power Automate (MSFT) or Zapier. 
- Detailed record to help diagnose workflows. 
- Simplified automation with Power Automate (MSFT). 

We will release our own connector in Power Automate's market, os you can create workflow either from admin portal or through Power Automate. Currently we are working with Microsoft on the initial release of our connector. We will keep you informed once we have released it.
