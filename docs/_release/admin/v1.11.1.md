# Highlights

To improve customer initial purchase DeskDirector's experience and help them start using it within 20~30 min after purchase, we have invested several improvements across board.

In support.deskdirector.com's portal, you should see your accounts page as home page. It should display your current subscription and invoice receiver email. You can update your credit card there.

For new customer, when instance not yet created, they will have option to create server from that page instead of submit form to trigger automation. They can monitor server deploy progress, once completed, they can head to admin page to finish rest of initialization.

## Server Initialize page
When server not yet been initialized or no members/resources been marked as master admin, admin portal will automatically redirect admin to initialize page. Which allow them to setup server.
