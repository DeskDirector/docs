**Added** a way to preview attachments before they are attached to the ticket. This allows users to check their screenshots for sensitive information etc.

**Added** a countdown dialog before taking a screenshot. This helps users understand that the app will minimise prior to taking the screenshot, and that the app has not crashed.

**Added** 3 more deeplinks relating to approvals (decline, auto_approve, auto_decline). More information can be found on the deeplinks documentation.

**Added** a paste area when creating tickets so users can paste images from their clipboard. This functionality is also supported when replying to a ticket that has already been created (paste into the reply textarea).
