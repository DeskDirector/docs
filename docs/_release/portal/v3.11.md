# Highlights

## Screenshot prompt
On the desktop version of Portal users are able to take screenshots of their desktop. To achieve this, the app minimises itself so that there is a clear shot of the background. The problem was that there was no warning that this would happen and the app would immediately minimise leading users to believe that the app had crashed. We've since added a prompt that gets displayed so users are fully aware that the app will minimise.

## File attachment previews
Previews are now shown any time attachments are uploaded to a ticket, allowing users to check whether they have uploaded the correct file.

## Improved request type UX
The request type page has been improved so that it's easier for users to explore the different options. We found that people were getting confused because there was no visual difference between a category and a request type. Now it's much more obvious which items are request types and which are categories.
