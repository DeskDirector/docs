## Custom Survey

Custom survey is one of our new feature that's coming to our survey product. It allows our customer to use email broadcast to send out custom survey, which can be used to collect many different kind of feedback.

Common usages are:
* Monthly feedback on user who created tickets
* Feedback for recent project completion
* Feedback for recent outage

Email broadcast can contain survey deep link with auto login token if you have it enabled. Once end user clicked the survey link, they will end up inside our client portal and ready to submit their feedback.

The survey deep link is formated as:
```
Survey ID: Survey's identifier
Campaign ID: Each email broadcast will create an email campaign, the campaign ID is from that. It is represented as an scope for the feedback collection.
URL: https://xxx.deskdirector.com/portal/deeplink?name=survey&survey_id={surveyId}&campaign_id={campaign_id}
```

## Pending Surveys
Within our client portal, user is able to view any pending survey. Whether it is recently closed ticket or it is triggered by email broadcast. Portal will display it there.

Once submitted, pending survey entry will be removed.
