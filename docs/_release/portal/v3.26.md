## Other choice in form

With latest admin portal release, you can now change identifiers of field or choices. Due to such capability, we have now added support to allow enter additional info when end user selected choice with identifier of `other`.

## Multi-select dynamic field behaviour changed

In the past, when user is unable to find the choice, form allow them to enter their own answer. Such capability has an weird behaviour, where it will remove any already selected choices.

## Sticky ticket actions

For ticket that has a lot of comments, it was hard to click on ticket actions, such as chat, print and refresh. With latest client portal release, we have introduced sticky actions. You can not only perform old ticket actions, you can also scroll to top or bottom of timeline with ease.

## Advanced form result display

For any ticket note or description that's been created by form, you can now open it in dialog. Where client portal will format it more close to original form.
