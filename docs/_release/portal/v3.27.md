# Highlights

## Pre-ticket chat in support options.

We have removed pre-ticket chat when out of business hours during release of 3.26. To improve user experience, rather than provide options to always show pre-ticket chat. System now has changed to disable it, rather than hide it.

## New form fields

We have plan to introduce time and phone fields since the beginning. With technical limitation and exist unplesent date picker, we have delayed release of those fields until now. 

Phone field is able to verify phone format based on country code. You can define default country in form designer. On submit, system will save phone as E164 format. That way, it is much easier to work with in automation or display under different environment.

Time field similar to phone field, system will record as 24 hours format, while display as 12 hours format.
