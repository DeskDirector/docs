# Highlights

## Home Page
The support page was created three to four years ago. It's time to rethink the user experience. The new home page introduced a widget system, which allows the system to display summarized information and allows users to search tickets at the global level.

This page will be available by the end of February. The old support options page will be replaced by the new home page once it is released. We intend to continue improving the home page's widget system, making it more structured and allowing for the introduction of custom widgets. 

To access home page preview, please use relative URL after impersonate contact or login as contact. Relative URL is: `/portal/v2/home`. e.g. `https://support.deskdirector.com/portal/v2/home`.

## New ticket experience
Since the release of user groups, customers have struggled to enforce user group usage. Rather than forcing users to always use a group, the new UI will attempt to educate them on how to choose the best action for them.
