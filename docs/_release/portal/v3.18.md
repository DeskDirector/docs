## Survey
Survey is a new feature we bring into our system. You can design survey inside admin portal, then user can take survey inside client portal for closed ticket.

DeskDirector's email event can be used to deliver survey. It will include deep link back to client portal, where user can fillout survey. There is also deep link support for ticket survey.

In the future, we will also explore Microsoft's adaptive card, so user can fill out survey within Office 365 email.

Take survey indicator can display under any screen size.
