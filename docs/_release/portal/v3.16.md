# Highlight

## Approval Dialog
User often want to enter long message or multi-line message when approve or decline a ticket. It gives more insight to the user who submitted request.

With 3.16 release, we have improved UX design of approval dialog. It uses ordinary text field rather than Google's Material design.

There is debat whether Google went too far on Material design, from their latest spec, it seems even they realized downside of such modern design. Client portal and TECH portal was based on Material design and we are slowly reverse this choice to make product more user friendly.
