- **IMPROVED** Attachments on ticket detail timeline now display subtle, especially email archive.

# Highlights

## Attachments on ticket detail
After we have introduced attachments in ticket, attachments have same level of visual appearance as ticket note, this cause distraction to our user. Especially email archive. With this release, we have improved visual appearance of attachments, they are more subtle. Also the icon on timeline now indicate the type of attachment. 

Email archieve in this visual change also been improved, instead of primary color on download link, it is now gray color and has clear text of `email archive`.
