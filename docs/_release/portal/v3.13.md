# Highlights

## Attachments on ticket detail
After we have introduced attachments in ticket, attachments have same level of visual appearance as ticket note, this cause distraction to our user. Especially email archive. With this release, we have improved visual appearance of attachments, they are more subtle. Also the icon on timeline now indicate the type of attachment. 

Email archieve in this visual change also been improved, instead of primary color on download link, it is now gray color and has clear text of `email archive`.

## Form improvements
Form has been one of key functionality we have. There are many new features or improvements we have planned. With latest minor release, we have addressed several issues and also added an new addition.

Material UI was designed by Google, it has been our design choice since portal v2. In recent years, many usability issue has been identified with such design. It is good for small device, it is not good for general usage. The design has fundamental issue which cause delay on user's reaction when they try to fill the form. 

With minor release, we have addressed issue with normal text input, number, email and URL input, dropdown. They are more obvious to be an input field rather than a line of nothing. In the future, we plan to fix many other fields that's still remain in material design. Such as date input, dynamic field, address input.

## Form default choice
For single choice field and multiple choice field, it is nice to provide default selected choice. With latest client portal and admin portal release, this is now possible.
