- **ADDED** Implemented OneNote notebook for user group. You can configure through admin portal.
- **ADDED** Allow ConnectWise user to filter tickets by site under All tickets user group.

# Highlight

## Allow filter by site for ConnectWise
As by popular request, we have now added support to allow filter tickets by site for ConnectWise. Any user who have access to all tickets will be able to utilize this feature.

For Autotask, we are collecting feedback on whether this is essential or game change for them. We have not yet indexed Autotask's ticket location, thus, to add support will cost us additional resource. Thus, we will leave Autotask out of this for now until later stage.

## Notebook for OneNote
OneNote notebook can be assigned to client portal's menu before, but alter menu for every company for different unique content is not fun. Each company may require different kind of content depends on scenario, such as meeting summary, service report etc. Such content are unique to given company.

DeskDirector has never stopped seeking for different way of offer content. If OneNote notebook is not for you, expect alternative approach in the future.
