# Highlight

## Allow filter by site for ConnectWise
By popular request, we have now added support to allow filtering tickets by site for ConnectWise. Any user who have access to all tickets will be able to utilize this feature.

For Autotask, we are collecting feedback on whether this is essential or a gamechanger for them. We have not yet indexed Autotask's ticket location, thus, adding support will cost us additional resource. Thus, we will leave Autotask out of this for now, until later stage.

## Notebook for OneNote
OneNote notebook can be assigned to client portal's menu before, but altering the menu for every company for different content is not fun. Each company (or user group) may require different content depending on different scenarios, such as meeting summary, service report etc. 

This release introduces support for OneNote Notebook assignment per user group.

DeskDirector has never stopped seeking for different ways of offering content. If OneNote notebook is not for you, expect alternative approach in the future.
