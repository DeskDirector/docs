# Apr 1st 2020 (version 3.11.0)

* **Added** a way to preview attachments before they are attached to the ticket. This allows users to check their screenshots for sensitive information etc.
* **Added** a countdown dialog before taking a screenshot. This helps users understand that the app will minimise prior to taking the screenshot, and that the app has not crashed.
* **Added** 3 more deeplinks relating to approvals (decline, auto_approve, auto_decline). More information can be found on the deeplinks documentation.
* **Added** a paste area when creating tickets so users can paste images from their clipboard. This functionality is also supported when replying to a ticket that has already been created (paste into the reply textarea).



# Highlights

## Screenshot prompt
On the desktop version of Portal users are able to take screenshots of their desktop. To achieve this, the app minimises itself so that there is a clear shot of the background. The problem was that there was no warning that this would happen and the app would immediately minimise leading users to believe that the app had crashed. We've since added a prompt that gets displayed so users are fully aware that the app will minimise.
