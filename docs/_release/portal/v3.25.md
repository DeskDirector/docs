# Highlights

## DeskDirector Form UI/UX adjustment

DeskDirector client portal web version 2 was deverloped by using Google's Material UI. It looks cool and was popular among Google fan club and by people who uses Android. Its actual usability is questionable. There was a lot of debat related to [floating labels](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/form-design-placeholders/) input. Thus, in recent years, we have been slowly move away from Material design. Client side DeskDirector form has been received many improvements within 3.24.2 and several other minor releases.

- Removed red background colour when field is invalid
- Improved error message of each field
- Added list count at left side of each field.
- Address field, dynamic field had UI/UX improve. They are more aligned with other fields now.
- Statement field has been restyled. Rather than as section separator, it is more towards original intention as content field for DeskDirector form.
- Improved checkbox and radio button style.

One of biggest change was **statement**. The original intention for statement field was for content play. The UI design at the time was like banner. It certainly looks cool. But over the time, we have discovered how people use the field was determined by how it looks, rather than original intention. It also looks ugly on long sentence.

Thus, in version 3.24.2, we have removed all style for statement field. Then with feedback from our customer, we have adjusted statement field again in this release. The additional adjustment in version 3.25.1 is to find middle ground. So our customer does not have to go through every form to adjust existing setup.

## File field

Many customer has been requesting for this field since initial release of DeskDirector form. With release of our file storage, we have also included new file field for DeskDirector form. New file storage allow us to upload file before ticket has been created, then associate file with ticket during creation.

File field allow end user to upload any kind of files. File size limit has been increased. Essential and basic subscription has been increased to 15MB. Where Dynamic and new subscription can upload file up to 100MB. There is also no number of files limit for each file field.

End user can preview not only image, but also video, audio, PDF. (Video and audio preview are experimental)

## Improvement on ticket timeline

With release of new file storage, we have also improved ticket's timline. It is now more aligned with TECH portal's style, where chat history, task list, survey became more subtle. Where normal communication is more prompt.

Any file been uploaded through new file storage are strongly associated with ticket itself or ticket note. We have also added carousel view for preview image files.
