# Highlight

## Improved side menu

As an web application, it make sense to allow right click to open in new tab. New side menu allows that.

## Improved switch account

In the past, switch account often cause confusion. Such as what it is for? What kind of state I am at? With version 3.21's release, we are trying to resolve those issues. 

* User who do not have additional account will only display company name without dropdown.
* For user who has additional account, they will only see the accounts they can switch to with email info.

## Improved profile dropdown

Setting under profile dropdown was too subtle, it is hard to recognize it. With the improvement, the dropdown is more modern and easier to figure out what can be clicked.
