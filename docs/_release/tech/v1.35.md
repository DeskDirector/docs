# Highlight

## Recast for email broadcast
Many of our customer has been using email broadcast since release. There was some difficulty on email campaign. Where Microsoft Office API has limitation on concurrent send email. Even though we have decreased batch process and also added auto-retry process, there will still be situation where manually trigger retry is needed.

Current logic on auto-retry is, each failed email attempt will have 3 auto retry. After that system will treat as failed attempt. Such failed email campaign can be recasted as long as broadcast has not yet expired.

Email broadcast recast will only perform for failed email delivery. Any successful delivery will be ignored.

## Survey (Dynamic Customer or Early adopter only)
Survey is a new feature we bring into our system. You can design survey inside admin portal, then user can take survey inside client portal for closed ticket. DeskDirector email event will also display take survey button for closed ticket event.

Once user has finished survey, you can view it from either admin portal or from ticket detail inside TECH portal.
