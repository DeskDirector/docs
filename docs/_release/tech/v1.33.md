## Multiple technician selection for assigned filter
The capability to list all the tickets that's been assigned to a specific group is an advanced scenario. While working on unassigned filter, we have enhanced UI/UX to provide capability to do that.

## Chat with technician improvement
Chat with technician is a feature we released with chat v4. The intention is to allow end user able to start a chat sesion without a ticket. The message user initially entered will goes with chat session's name.

This creates problem when the title of chat session goes too long. Where TECH portal's chat window unable to display with full content.

With 1.33 release, UI is now able to recognize non-system session title and render it as chat message within chat window.
