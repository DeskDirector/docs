# Highlights

## Ticket List Mobile View
Ticket list's mobile view has been greatly enhanced. The goal for mobile interface is allow technician to work on site, so they can quickly find the ticket assigned to them.

It can also have basic search, filter and pagination.

## Ticket List Item
To help technician quickly scan tickets, ticket list item has been redesigned. It included following change.
1. Assigned only default display two technician. If a given ticket has more than two technician, it will display count. (the count is click and expandable)
2. We now display tags. Tags is native category option that we provide for you. Tag provide provide capability for complex category scenario. e.g. DeskDirector ticket can belong to multiple categories, such as `portal` and `server`. Category and sub category cannot achieve that.
3. We use our system's record to display last ticket note or time entry. It may not be 100% accurate, just something to help notify the difference since last read.
4. To help quick filter, you can now click *company*, *assigned* or *tag* from ticket list item.

## Board, Status facet
Facet is an important feature for ticket list. It provide fast navigation between board and status. With new ticket list release, we have improved visual appearance. 

1. When status has been selected, board no longer highlighted, but became bolder. This gives clear indication where you at.
2. When filter been adjusted, if count on board or status is zero, we use to hide it. We now keep display it if you have selected it.
