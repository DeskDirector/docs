## Leave chat session
It was always pain after join an chat session. Even after invited other technician into chat, original technician is unable to leave until chat is ended. With this release, we allow them to do so.

As long as there is another technician that's online or away, exist technician can leave chat session. This allows dispatcher to much easier to work with chat handling.

## Chat history list
History list was developed at early stage of TECH. Many design aspect was not up to date. With chat rewrite, we put little effort to make it easier to scan. We have also added capability to display all kind of chat session. Included chat session that's not yet closed.
