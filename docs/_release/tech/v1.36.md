# Highlight

## Improved User Profile Dropdown

Our user profile dropdown contains a lot of useful informations. The informations themselves helped diagnose chat related issues and also reveal the current state of the system. But it is also an issue where user require scroll to see all the options.

From the improvements we have done within this release, scroll has been removed. The content is also much more compact and easier to read. We have removed many unnecessary informations also shrink down amount of white space.

We have also changed `Busy` state to `Do Not Disturb`. This is to help our customer to have correct expectation of use that state. When a given user is on `Do Not Disturb`, they won't receive browser notification regarding chat.
