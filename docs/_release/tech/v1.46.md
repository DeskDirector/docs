## Tag enhancement

The tag system is an unrestricted way to categorise entities; you do not need to define anything before using it. However, dealing with typos is difficult. You can now predefine tags in this release. The UI will then provide suggestion when you want to filter list by tags or add tags to any entities.

Tag type is used to instruct the UI on the tag's intent. The UI will only show related tags by default, and will then use tag type to provide better suggestions when the user types in. 

- `generic`: when tag without any type. It will display under any entity
- `service`: Ticket, task templates, survey, request type, request group, form, workflow, email template
- `company`: Company, user group, form, menu item, menu group, request type, request group, survey, task template, email template, workflow
- `contact`: Contact, user group, form, menu item, menu group, request type, request group, survey, task template, email template, workflow
- `agent`: Agent, workflow, email template
