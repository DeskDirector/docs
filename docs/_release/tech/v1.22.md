# Highlights

## Ticket priority filter
We have now added priority filter to ticket list. If you have large amount of tickets under a single status, it is now much easier to view high priority tickets.

On top of priority filter, ticket list item's priority indicator can now be clickable. Once clicked, the list will be filtered by that priority.

## New tab system
In version 1.21, we had issue where tab was not registered, we have now take time to look into the existing tab system and decide to completely rewrite it. Here we are, the new tab system.

There are number of improvements. Which I will list them below.
1. Tab's width is now consistent, and equal. 
2. Delete button is now hidden until mouse over.
3. Active and inactive tab is now more obvious
4. Ticket tab no longer have icon indication, since ticket tab is default tab.
5. Temporary tab concept

Existing tabs will be migrated to the new system.

## Temporary tab
Each new tab will be registered as temporary tab, new temporary tab will override existing one. You can click temporary tab to pin it. Pinned tab will be persisted.

Pinned tabs have up limit of 8. Tab is a good place to treat as bookmark, user will ignore tab if there are way too many tabs. Mouse over to figure out which one is the one you want is painful.

## Ticket list under company and contact page
Ticket list for company and contact page has now been fixed. Since introduce of new ticket list, those pages were broken. We have now added it back with new style.

Different to normal ticket list, it has state indicator to indicate whether it is open or closed ticket.
