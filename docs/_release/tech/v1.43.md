# Highlight

## Tickets filtering improvement

One thing that has been missing since the introduction of the native task feature is the ability to filter by task completion state. You can now filter tickets by task completion state with this release.

On top of that, we've added due time ordering, due time filtering, and more assigned filter options. 

* New assigned filter. On top of unassigned, assigned to me, or assigned to someone. You can not list all tickets been assigned.
* Due time filter can filter out tickets without due time.
