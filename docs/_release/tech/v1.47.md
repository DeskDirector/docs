# Highlight

## Internal Task List

The task list has been an excellent way to establish pending tasks for a given ticket and track the task list's progress. The use case has been limited because it is also visible to the end user. We expanded the functionality of the task list to allow it to be used for internal operations. You can now create an internal task list, with progress and content visible only to agents.
