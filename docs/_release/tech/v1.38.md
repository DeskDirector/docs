## Chat now adapt to latest security change from browser
Customer with custom domain may encounter issue if they have setup their browser to not include 3rd party cookies. Since our chat server is under domain `deskdirector.com`, where custom domain is under your own domain. Such combination cause chat server's cookie became 3rd party cookies. Which got blocked by browser.

We have changed the way of authorization from cookie to Authentication header for chat server. With such improvement, chat should be working for customer wuth custom domain and on high restrict browser setting.
