## Chat server connection state
With release of 1.24, user avatar's dropdown now has information regarding push notification server's state. This is important information to help user understand whether their internet has issue or not. Whether there is firewall rule that's blocked push notification or whether browser notification has not yet been setup.

## Remove assigned resource and manage CC for ConnectWise
For Autotask and ConnectWise user, there are one missing piece for assigned resource, which is unassign. This is now implemented with this release.

## Display code block inside ticket note
Since we use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to render ticket note or time entry, the code block was not functional correctly for code block in TECH. With this release, it has been fixed.
