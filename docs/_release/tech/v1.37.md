## Add time entry for Autotask
This functionality has been missing since TECH portal been released, we aware of high demand.

From this TECH portal release, TECH portal now officially support add time entry for Autotask.

## Go to ticket by ticket number for Autotask
Go to ticket was only available for ConnectWise TECH portal in the past, where you can enter ticket number and navigate to ticket right away. Because unique design of Autotask ticket ID, TECH portal was not able to support in the past. With this release, Autotask user can now navigate to ticket with ease.

## Time Range select
Time entry's time range select was simple and easy to use. But there are still improvements can be done. With latest change, you can add time entry that start from mid-night and end at next day. In the past, you can only select time range within today.

## Improved time entry dropdown options
Some of our customer has been reporting display issue for dropdown under Android Pixel 1. We are unable to reproduce, to get around the issue, we have changed dropdown to native HTML select. That should help display under any device.

## Improve ticket information panel
As more and more of our customer start using TECH portal, one of improvements they have been reporting is ticket information panel. Board/Queue, status and many other information been pushed outside of normal view. They cannot change any of them with ease unless use scroll.

With latest release, ticket information panel has been redesigned. Many of information been merged or restyled. Which will take less space. We wish customer who uses TECH portal enjoy this change.
