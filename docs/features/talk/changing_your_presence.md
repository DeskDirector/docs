# Changing your presence

## Tech

It is possible in TECH to force your [presence](../../glossary/p/presence.md) to `Away` or `Busy`.

You can do this by clicking your avatar on the top-left of the app:

![Change presence](./img/change_presence_1.png)

![Change presence dropdown](./img/change_presence_2.png)

You can also sign out from this drop down.

To reset your presence from `Away` or `Busy` just change your presence to `Online`.

## Portal

It is not possible for Portal users to force change their presence. They are either `Online`, `Away`, or `Offline`.
