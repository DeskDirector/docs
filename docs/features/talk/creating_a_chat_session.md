# Creating a Chat Session

## Tech

Tech users can only create chat sessions from a ticket at this stage and only if that ticket has an online contact assigned to the ticket. This is what's known as a push-chat, where a chat session is created with a target user.

## Portal

Portal users can create [chat sessions](../../glossary/c/chat_session.md) in 2 places:

- the Request Support screen (pre-ticket chat)
- on an existing ticket (post-ticket chat)

### Pre-ticket chat

Portal users can now request to chat before they have created a ticket. They can do this by heading to `Request Support > Chat to a Technician`. Users can only have one active pre-ticket chat open at any one time. 'Active' is defined as being in either the [waiting](../../glossary/c/chat_session.md) or [handled](../../glossary/c/chat_session.md) state.

### Post-ticket chat

Users can also chat on an existing ticket by heading to `Open Tickets > {ticket} > Chat Icon`. These chat sessions will have the ticket number attached to them so members/resources will be able to easily pull up the relevant ticket. Users can only have one active ticket chat open, per ticket, at any one time. 'Active' is defined as being in either the [waiting](../../glossary/c/chat_session.md) or [handled](../../glossary/c/chat_session.md) state. Post-ticket chat sessions cannot be created on closed tickets.
