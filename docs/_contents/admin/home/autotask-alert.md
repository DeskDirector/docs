Autotask introduced integration API 1.6 earlier last year, and they will deprecate and remove the existing integration API 1.5 by end of this year.

On DeskDirector server release 18.102.x, we will officially move to Autotask integration API 1.6. Customers still using the old resource will see the integration stop working: they are required to create a new API resource before server release.

Please check our article on [how to create API resource for integration API v1.6](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/tltfs99ggj-creating-an-integrator-resource-in-autotask).

**Server release is scheduled as 4th of Dec for Oceanic region, 9th of Dec for USA, Canada, Europe.**
