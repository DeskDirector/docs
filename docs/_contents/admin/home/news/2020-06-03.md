<h4>NEW SINGLE SIGN IN PAGE FOR YOUR DESKDIRECTOR PORTAL</h4>
<p>We're happy to announce we've made big improvements to our login page.</p>
<h5>What's New At A Glance</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Simplified and streamlined single login page that starts by just asking you to enter your email</li>
  <li>Consistent experience for all platforms</li>
  <li>Much better error handling and UX</li>
  <li>Allows new end users to provide basic information to help creating an account</li>
  <li>When end users with multiple accounts are signing in the User Portal, it asks them which account they want to sign in to upfront</li>
</ul>

<h5>Useful Information</h5>
<ul>
  <li>PHASE 1 (now): only the root URL will route to new login page, while /admin/v2 will still route to the old login page;</li>
  <li>PHASE 2 (week following PHASE 1): the Admin Portal should navigate to new login page by default. (from front-end);</li>
  <li>PHASE 3 (1~2 weeks from PHASE 2): the Tech Portal should reside to new login page;</li>
  <li>PHASE 4 (2~4 weeks from PHASE 3): the User Portal should use login page (we could make this earlier depending on how smoothly the previous phases are)</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
