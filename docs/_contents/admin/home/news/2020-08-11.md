### This is an important communication regarding the deprecation of TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 servers. 

IF you are a legacy client user with a version over 5 years old, you will be affected by this change as this only supports TLS 1.0.

**The deprecation is scheduled for this October the 20th, 2020.**

 
#### Why we are deprecating
TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are out-of-date protocols that do not support modern cryptographic algorithms - the vast majority of encrypted Internet traffic is now over TLS 1.2, which was introduced over a decade ago, so it's time for an upgrade,


#### What can I do?
Our recommendation is for you to move away from the legacy portal and uninstall / reinstall a fresh version of the client portal.

##### How to uninstall the legacy version
To uninstall our Windows portal you can use the uninstallation script we have created, downloadable [here](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/huqqqba1r0-ddportal-removal-tool-uninstalling-windows-portals?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz--mIiGrZUwadGlw5IsLEPQAhj7P53wL9H9XstVnVU_9aOQYm-kFEHQjR4AYAQVC96Cy6C22#basic_usage_guide). 

On any given machine, you can download the script and execute the following command

`DdUninstaller /quiet`


##### How to install the newest version
Once the portal is successfully uninstalled, you can proceed to install the latest portal.
 

#### I need more time
In the eventuality that are reliant on the legacy client and you need more time than the 20th of October, you can request to be put in a Quarantine Server at the cost of $200 per month.

To request transfer to the Quarantine Server you can click [here](https://support.deskdirector.com/portal/deeplink?name=request_type&type_id=118) and fill our form. Our support team will pick it up and get back to you.
