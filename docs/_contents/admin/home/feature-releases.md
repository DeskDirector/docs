### AI Enhancements Across Portals
AI-powered assistance is now available across both the TECH and client portals, bringing smarter and more efficient support experiences.
- **Client Portal**: End users can now benefit from AI assistance, which leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to find the most relevant knowledge base articles and provide accurate, AI-generated responses. This helps users resolve their requests faster and more effectively.
- **TECH Portal**: Agents now have access to Copilot, which assists in drafting and refining ticket responses. It enables agents to rephrase messages for better clarity or formality and engage in AI-powered conversations for tasks such as summarizing tickets, answering technical questions, or generating task listsâ€”boosting efficiency and productivity.

### Tag suggestion

The tag system is an unrestricted way to categorise entities; you do not need to define anything before using it. However, dealing with typos is difficult. You can now predefine tags in this release. The UI will then provide suggestion when you want to filter list by tags or add tags to any entities.

Some of our customers are required to obtain their clients' signatures. You can now do so using the DeskDirector form. DeskDirector managed storage will be used to store the signature. Similarly to the file field, we do not intend to save within PSA.

### Ticket Dynamic Content

DeskDirector is constantly looking for new ways to expand our product. Since form dynamic content, you now have another tool at your disposal: ticket dynamic content. The concept of dynamic content is the same: develop your API in accordance with our specifications, and then our UI will use the information provided by your API to render pre-defined UI components.

### XSS and Clickjacking protection

Individual settings can be applied to the auth, client, and TECH portals. It gives you more say over what you want to accomplish. ([detail](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/x0uf2mlhxq), Admin [1.37](/configs/release-notes/admin/v1.37.1))

The workflow provided native event and filter to help you build automation. Our DeskDirector Power Automate connectors has also released in Microsoft Store which you can use. (Admin [1.28](/configs/release-notes/admin/v1.28.1))

### User groups

Every company or organization has several ways to group their employees. Groupings can be per location, branch, teams, departments, roles and others. Initially, in DeskDirector, grouping was very limited to using group tags. Not only was this very tedious to create and manage, it was also very unintuitive.

So, we introduced User Groups! With this feature, you can easily scope access for users in the client portal. It is much easier to use and manage, more intuitive and visually appealing compared to using group tags. Now, you can easily create several groups under one company (e.g. HR, IT, Accounting, Management and others) and assign specific contacts for each.
