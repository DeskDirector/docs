With release of ConnectWise **2020.3**, we have notice one of ConnectWise API is broken. We are working closely with ConnectWise on this issue, and we will keep everyone updated through admin portal's home page.

The API broken is only cause issue with Microsoft Automate (Flow) integration. Up until now, ConnectWise has not yet fixed the issue, in most of cases, there won't be any impact to your DeskDirector server, unless you are using Flow integration.
