DeskDirector discovered an issue with one of the ConnectWise `2022_2` builds; the bug is currently affecting all cloud customers in Australia and the North American regions. We implemented a workaround and deployed to all ConnectWise customers and also reported the problem. We will work with ConnectWise to resolve the issue. Please read the full issue report [here](https://help.deskdirector.com/article/h31872k058).

We do not recommend that on-premise ConnectWise customers upgrade to the latest 2022 2 builds.
