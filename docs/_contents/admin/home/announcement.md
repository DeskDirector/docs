Here's some of the highlights:
+ **Host Settings**: with this admin Portal release, you can now configure settings based on server DNS
+ **Test Email Templates**: the Admin Portal now allows you to not only test email delivery method, but also to specify which template you want to test
+ **Ticket global events toggle**: we have moved them to a new location. You can toggle approval emails separately.
+ **New email setting section**: System Template.

Again, the above list is just a super quick rundown of all the goodness we have packed into this release. [Go Read the full Release Note Here](/release-notes/admin/v1.12.1).
