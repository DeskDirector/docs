**Work From Anywhere with DeskDirector**

The COVID-19 crisis continues to evolve. You and your customers will want your people to work from home effectively. Many are working from home already. 

We created a [Work From Anywhere Support Center page](https://deskdirector.com/wfh) to help, linked here in the Admin Console and on our [DD Support Portal](https://support.deskdirector.com/).

We will keep updating and enriching with tools to help you succeed during these unprecedented times. We added it to our support portal menu and your DD Admin Console to keep it 100% accessible at all times.



**Our new Onboarding Center is up and running**

After much thought and feedback from our awesome community, we've decided to put all of our guidelines together into a collection of onboarding resources, knowledge base articles and best practice tips specifically designed to help you set up your portal as quickly as possible.

It's by no means comprehensive and it's not designed to replace our thorough library of KB. Rather, it should help you focus on what needs your immediate attention as opposed to everything else that you can achieve with our awesome solution at a later date.
It will always be accessible via our [support.deskdirector.com](https://support.deskdirector.com/), we've created a new Onboarding Center menu item.

So, if you're new(ish) around here and you missed out on our onboarding emails (can't blame you) fear no more, now we've put all you need in one place.
And if you're not new, we recommend you check it out anyway as it's a great chance to see if you did all you could with your Portal!
