### PRODUCT UPDATE

The feature release list has been an excellent way to share product updates, but it has gradually taken over the entire page and still lacks detailed context. As a result, we have moved them to a [separate page](/configs/release-notes/feature-releases) and are only highlighting three of the most recent features here. 

* Tag suggestion (Admin [1.40](/configs/release-notes/admin/v1.40.1), TECH [1.46](/configs/release-notes/tech/v1.46))
* Signature Field (Admin [1.39](/configs/release-notes/admin/v1.39.1), TECH [1.45](/configs/release-notes/tech/v1.45), Portal [3.31](/configs/release-notes/portal/v3.31))
* Ticket Dynamic Content (Admin [1.37](/configs/release-notes/admin/v1.37.1), TECH [1.44](/configs/release-notes/tech/v1.44), Portal [3.30](/configs/release-notes/portal/v3.30))

More information can be found on [the feature releases page](/configs/release-notes/feature-releases). 

### Deprecation announcement

We'd like to provide an update since the deprecation list was announced 11 months ago. 

* The wufoo form integration has been deprecated for years, and the admin portal setup page will be removed from service by the end of the year. 
* All legacy chat-related pages, including the feature preview page, have been removed. 
* We no longer support legacy desktop applications. (HUD - Old TECH, Client portal v1, v2 and v3)
* We will provide limited support for client portal version 4 by ensuring that all APIs on which it relies are operational. The legacy installer page will be removed from service by the end of the year.

-- The deprecation announcement was last updated on September 12th, 2022.
