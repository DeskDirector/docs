**Happy 2020!**

We would like to greet you into this new decade - we hear that the 20s are usually roaring :smiley:

We haven't been idle for too long over here (and it's even summer here in NZ!) and just released a new version of the Admin Console: v1.8!

But that's not it, we have one more surprise to kick off the new year in style.
If you haven't noticed yet, we've added Analytics in for you to get your data fix. You will get access to Portal Usage reports and - drumroll - Service Radar!

Enjoy  
The Team at DeskDirector
